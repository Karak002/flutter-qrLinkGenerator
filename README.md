# qr_code_library

this is a simple pretty clean widget that, taking a url as input, generates a qr code, with the possibility of setting the various sizes and colors

the parameters that can be used are:

**Url**: is the only mandatory parameter, you can enter anything such as a phrase, a link etc ...

**dimension**: which by default is equal to 150x150 and must be passed as a string in this way "150x150"


**backgoundColor**: which by default is white, can be set by passing it a hexadecimal color, an example is this: "FFFFFF"

**lineColor**: is used to change the color of the internal drawing of the qr code, by default it is set to black ("000000"), an example of an accepted value is this: "FFF001"

<span style="color:red">I advise you to pay attention to the choice of colors, colors that are too similar to each other could create difficulties in recognizing the qr code</span>.
